# Intermediate_SQL_Course_Luke_Barousse
Practise Queries and Project from the intermediate SQL course by Luke Barousse

I started this query as a practise note for studying with Luke Barousse in his online youtube course 'Intemediate SQL'.  
  
Luke used the Contoso database, which is a dummy database created by Microsoft for learners' practising purpose. The database covers relational tables including 'sales' 'customer' 'product' 'store' etc. I found it perfect for me to do the data analysis also using the method I learned from the full SQL course in 'data with Baraa'.
  
Thus in this repository, I documented in the scripts folder the following items:
- scripts 1 to 3, are learning notes of Lukes' course.
- script 4: EDA in the Contoso Data base. I wrote query digging into the tables and columns, trying to understand the business Contoso was in, exploring measures and dimentions.
- script 5: Data Analysis 1.0. This part is the query I wrote to answer questions including:
  - what is the sales development globally? by country?
  - seasonality analysis
  - what is the best performing stores?
  - Check Price, cost and margin development over the years, by category and subcategoy.
  - Compare Customers, Orders, Revenue and Profitability of each Region, Rank them by three year average.
-  script 6: Data Analysis 2.0. I made three reports out of the analysis: **Customer**, **Product** and **Store**.
